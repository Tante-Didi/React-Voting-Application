##React Voting Application,

This project is a simple voting application built with React. 

It should contain a Form, a main page, a User page, and an Admin page.

#Project Structure
Form: For user login and registration.
Main Page: To display voting options and results.
User Page: For user-specific actions and information.
Admin Page: For administrative tasks and overview.
Current Status
Unfortunately, I did not manage to implement the API logic, and the CSS stopped working when I started writing useState and useEffect hooks. As a result, I put these parts in comments and did not progress further.
